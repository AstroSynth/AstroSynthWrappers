# AstroSynthWrappers
Eventually a set of data wrappers for different data sets that are meant to emulate the interface of astroSynth, so that all code written to work with astroSynth can also work with these data sets. Currently this project has only focued on building a wrapper around Palomar Transient Factory Data.

# NOTE
This repository, while publically avalible is not nessisarily intended for use by anyone other than me, that is all to say that this code will likely not work for whatever you may try and do. If if does great, all the better, but I wrote it with some pretty narrow goals and unusual assumtptions. While these were valid in my case they are most likely not valid in yours. Anyways thats all there, have a great day!

## Prerequisits
1) MongoDB installed
2) UNIX system
3) MongoDB should have PTF data stored in a collection
