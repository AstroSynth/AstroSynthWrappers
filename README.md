# AstroSynthWrappers
Eventually a set of data wrappers for different data sets that are meant to emulate the interface of astroSynth, so that all code written to work with astroSynth can also work with these data sets. Currently this project has only focued on building a wrapper around Palomar Transient Factory Data.

## Prerequisits
1) MongoDB installed
2) UNIX system
3) MongoDB should have PTF data stored in a collection
